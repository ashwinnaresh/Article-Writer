# alchemyapi_php #

A software development kit (sdk) for AlchemyAPI using PHP



## AlchemyAPI ##

AlchemyAPI offers artificial intelligence as a service. We teach computers to learn how to read and see, and apply our technology to text analysis and image recognition through a cloud-based API. Our customers use AlchemyAPI to transform their unstructured content such as blog posts, news articles, social media posts and images into much more useful structured data. 

AlchemyAPI is a tech startup located in downtown Denver, Colorado. As the world's most popular text analysis service, AlchemyAPI serves over 3.5 billion monthly API requests to over 35,000 developers. To enable our services, we use artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural networks, natural language processing and massive-scale web crawling. Our technology powers use cases in a variety of industry verticals, including social media monitoring, business intelligence, content recommendations, financial trading and targeted advertising.

## API Key ##

To use AlchemyAPI, you'll need to obtain an API key and attach that key to all requests. If you do not already have a key, please visit: http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/register.html



## Demo ##

To use our interactive web demo, which includes access to all of AlchemyAPI's text analysis functions, please visit: http://www.alchemyapi.com/products/demo. You can use the demo to get a better understanding of how the text analysis functions work, and run some of your sample data through it to see what kind of results you can expect. The demo calls the exact same API functions as this SDK.



## Getting Started with the PHP SDK ##

To get started and run the example, simply:

	git clone https://github.com/AlchemyAPI/alchemyapi_php.git
	cd alchemyapi_php
	php alchemyapi.php YOUR_API_KEY
	php example.php


Just replace YOUR_API_KEY with your 40 character API key from AlchemyAPI, and you should be good to go.

	

## Using the PHP SDK ##

This SDK makes accessing all of AlchemyAPI's text analysis functions with PHP easy. The following is a list of the available functions and how to use them within your application. For working code examples of these, please checkout the example code and run the example as described in the "Getting Started with the PHP SDK" section above. 



### Creating the AlchemyAPI object ###

To use each function, you must first create an AlchemyAPI object. The easiest way to do this is:

	<?php
		require_once 'alchemyapi.php';
		$alchemyapi = new AlchemyAPI();
	?>

You can now use this object to access AlchemyAPI's text analysis functions. 

### Image Keywords ###

The Image Keywords API tags an image identified by a URL or image data posted in the body of an html request. For more high-level information on AlchemyAPI's Image keywords API, please visit: http://www.alchemyapi.com/products/features/image-tagging. For more technical information, please refer to the docs: http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/image-tagging.

To extract entities, use:

	<?php
		$response = $alchemyapi->image_keywords(FLAVOR, DATA, OPTIONS);
	?>

Where FLAVOR can be 'url' or 'image' DATA is your url or uri-argument encoded image data, and OPTIONS is an array containing the optional parameters to modify the behavior of the call.


**Options**

The following options are available for this call. To use, include your desired options into an array and pass it as the OPTIONS parameter in the call. 

-	imagePostMode -> (only applicable to image flavor)
-		not-raw :  pass an unencoded image file with "image=URI_ENCODED_DATA"
-		raw     :  pass an unencoded image file using POST
-	extractMode -> 
-     always-infer    :  (more CPU intensive, more accurate)
-     trust-metadata  :  (less CPU intensive, less accurate) (default)
-     only-metadata   :  (even less CPU intensive, less accurate)

**Parsing**

To parse the results, simply step through the response structure that is detailed in the docs. For example, here's how to print the keyword and score of each tagged image:

	<?php
		$response = $alchemyapi->image_keywords('url','http://www.lolcats.com/images/u/08/50/lolcatsdotcomur5dhkw464f8hb16.jpg', null);
		foreach ($response['imageKeywords'] as $imagekeyword) {
			echo 'keyword: ', $imagekeyword['text'], PHP_EOL;
			echo 'score: ', $imagekeyword['score'], PHP_EOL;
		}
	?>

This should print out:
	
	keyword: cat
	score: 0.999697
	keyword: kitten
	score: 0.942676

	


### Entities ###

The entity extraction API identifies the proper nouns in your text, HTML or URL content. These are the named people, companies, organizations and locations.

For more technical information, please refer to the docs: http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/entity-extraction.

To extract entities, use:

	<?php
		$response = $alchemyapi->entities(FLAVOR, DATA, OPTIONS);
	?>

Where FLAVOR can be 'text','html', or 'url', DATA is your text, html or url content, and OPTIONS is an array containing the optional parameters to modify the behavior of the call.


**Options**

The following options are available for this call. To use, include your desired options into an array and pass it as the OPTIONS parameter in the call. 

- disambiguate -> disambiguate entities (i.e. Apple the company vs. apple the fruit). 0: disabled, 1: enabled (default)
- linkedData -> include linked data on disambiguated entities. 0: disabled, 1: enabled (default) 
- coreference -> resolve coreferences (i.e. the pronouns that correspond to named entities). 0: disabled, 1: enabled (default)
- quotations -> extract quotations by entities. 0: disabled (default), 1: enabled.
- sentiment -> analyze sentiment for each entity. 0: disabled (default), 1: enabled. Requires 1 additional API transction if enabled.
- showSourceText -> 0: disabled (default), 1: enabled 
- maxRetrieve -> the maximum number of entities to retrieve (default: 50)


**Parsing**

To parse the results, simply step through the response structure that is detailed in the docs. For example, here's how to print the text and type of each extracted entity:

	<?php
		$response = $alchemyapi->entities('text','I like Ford cars better than icecream.', null);
		foreach ($response['entities'] as $entity) {

		}
	?>

This should print out:

	concept: Fruit
	relevance: 0.865419



### Sentiment ###

The sentiment analysis API calculates the document-level sentiment of your text, HTML or URL content. Sentiment determines whether the content is positive or negative, and can be calculated for the entire document, a user-specified target, or at the keyword, entity or relational level. This API call is only for document sentiment. To get keyword, entity or relational sentiment, set the OPTION parameter {'sentiment':1} in the respective call. Targeted sentiment is handled by a seperate call as well. For more high-level information on AlchemyAPI's sentiment analysis API, please visit: http://www.alchemyapi.com/products/features/sentiment-analysis. For more technical information, please refer to the docs: http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/sentiment-analysis.

	?>

Where FLAVOR can be 'text','html', or 'url', DATA is your text, html or url content, and OPTIONS is an array containing the optional parameters to modify the behavior of the call.


**Options** 

The following options are available for this call. To use, include your desired options into an array and pass it as the OPTIONS parameter in the call.

		echo 'sentiment: ', $response['docSentiment']['type'], PHP_EOL;
		echo 'score: ', $response['docSentiment']['score'], PHP_EOL;
	?>

This should print out:

	sentiment: positive
	score: 0.631595


NOTE: The sentiment type can be either positive, negative or neutral. The score is only returned for positive and negative sentiment, and is not included in the response structure for neutral sentiment.



### Targeted Sentiment ###

The targeted sentiment analysis API calculates the document-level sentiment of your text, HTML or URL content in relation to a specified target. The targets are typically brand names, product names, specific features and similar. Please see the sentiment section above for more info about sentiment analysis.

To calculate targeted sentiment for an entire document, use:

	<?php
		$response = $alchemyapi->sentiment_targeted(FLAVOR, DATA, TARGET, OPTIONS);
	?>

Where FLAVOR can be 'text','html', or 'url', DATA is your text, html or url content, TARGET is the user-specified target, and OPTIONS is an array containing the optional parameters to modify the behavior of the call.
